GameStop Response
<h2>GameStop response </h2>

<p>This is a response that is upon reflection of the recent GameStop stories where its stock price rose around 1700%.  <br>I got interested in the story when Kevin O'Leary, better known as Mr. Wonderful, came out with a statement regarding the controversy.
<br><br>
For reference here is an image of Mr. Wonderful:

<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/kevin-oleary-advice-on-gamestop-frenzy.html">This link is referencing an article about Kevin O'Leary's comments about the topic</a>
<br>
<p> Kevin O'Leary is a Canadian businessman who is a star on ABC's Shark Tank.  O'Leary is worth around $400 million.  O'Leary along with other Shark Tank star and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban are supporting and egging on the individual people who invested in GameStop. 
<br>	
<br> Kevin was been quoted saying that "The bottom line is, we've got millions of new players on the market, and that's always better."  I agree with Kevin, as a young woman who is interested in investing money, has an investment account and has also dabbled in sports betting, I concur that more people on the market is a good thing and allows more learning.
<br>
<br> I mention my sports betting experience because O'Leary had also made a comment about day trading.  I am paraphrasing O'Leary when I say day trading is not investing, investing means having your money in the market for the long run while day trading is similar to gambling.  O'Leary made this imporatnt comparison from investing to gambling, it is important to mention that O'Leary also said "there's nothing wrong with day trading."  It's just not investing. 
<br>
<br> Kevin O'Leary's Shark Tank Co-Host Mark Cuban also spoke out about the GameStop saga.  Mark Cuban is not only a host on Shark Tank, but he also is the owner of the Dallas Mavericks Basketball Team. <br><br> Here is an image of Mark Cuban:

<p> Cuban's comments on the subject were informative and educational.  He said that it is not out of the ordinary for "heavily shorted stocks" to be targeted.  The difference is that the targeting on GameStop comes from a different group of people.  Ordinarily it would be hedge funds that target the shorted stocks.  Cuban says that this GameStop saga is a saga because "the people who are making the push aren't who we expect them to be," Cuban goes on to say, "so that's why I like it."

<br>
<br>

Marc Cuban also touched on the day trading that Kevin O'Leary spoke about.  I would paraphrase Cuban but I wont do it justice so here is the quote: <q>As long as we’re allowing companies to trade stocks in milliseconds, how can we expect this to be an investors market? Until you change that, you can’t change what’s happening with WallStreetBets.</q>
<br>
<br>
This quote pulls attention to the issue of day trading and how that has an impact on the stock market.  Day trading gambling not investing as O'Leary has said, Cuban has backed O'Leary by bringing attention to the issue that the market is "dominated by traders".  
<br>
After doing my research I can understand why this has been such a big story and gad a large impact on those interested in the Stock Market.  O'Leary and Kevin both seem to be excited about the individual investors joining the stock market, but additionally they both made sure to mention the uncertainties and dangers in day trading. </p>
