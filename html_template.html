	<h2>Comparing fuel efficiency and horsepower</h2>
	<p>Internal combustion engines face a fundamental engineering trade-off: more powerful engines are also less fuel efficient. We can see this relationship clearly in this visualization:</p>

	<!--Vega visualization goes here-->

	<p>This relationship is interesting because it is non-linear: fuel efficiency drops rapidly with the increase in horsepower.</p>
